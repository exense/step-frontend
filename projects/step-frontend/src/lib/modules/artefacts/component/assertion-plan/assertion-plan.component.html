        An assertion plan containing an AssertMetric control declares assertions to be performed on the executions
        related to one scheduler task within a given time. The failure of an assertion plan triggers an event of type
        "ScheduledTaskAssertionsFailedEventType". An AssertMetric can be used to ensure that the number of failures of
        the executions related to a scheduler task entry remains below a defined threshold.<br />
        Add this plan to any scheduler task as its assertion plan to check the given assertions after every execution.

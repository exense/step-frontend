        An assertion plan declares assertions to be performed on the series of executions of a scheduler task. It is
        executed after each execution of the scheduler task and triggers an event of type “Assertion of task failed“
        upon failure. <br />
        Typically an assertion plan consists of one or more AssertMetric controls that specify the assertions.
        AssertMetric can be for instance used to ensure that the number of failures of the executions related to a
        scheduler task entry remains below a defined threshold.
